Welcome to the Ultramarine Wiki! This wiki is meant to be the extended documentation for both end users and developers, so it is separated in those two categories.

On this page you can read about all the general project information, so if you want to become familiar with important concepts and our philosophy make sure to read this first!

## General philosophy
Ultramarine Linux is meant to be a spiritual successor to Korora Linux, with the goal of making an operating system that "just works". We are making the base Fedora experience a little more pleasant with tweaks, which improves the experience for new and advanced users equally. 
While most tweaks could be achieved by an install script, such a script defeats the idea of "it just works" out of the box as the user has to apply things manually. Other planned features like a custom installer with better user experience are not possible without a separate ISO.

## Planned features
- Welcome app for user onboarding with quick access to common actions
- System configuration application similar to YaST
- Custom installer to improve user experience compared to Anaconda which has a possibly overwhelming interface for new users
- Good unified documentation for both developers and end users
- Possible but not set in stone: DNF GUI frontend for easy package installation
